# Experiment-Data-6-UPRU
There are two data tables, among which the table "IdentificationData.xls" represents the data used to identify the basic dynamic parameters, and the table "ValidationData.xls" represents the data under a new trajectory used to validate the fitting performance of the identification results. 
Each set of data includes the observation matrix and force sensor data at 1000-time instants. 
The zero offsets of the six force sensors are [-90.7; 14.7; -42.7; -31.4; -14.0; -21.7].
